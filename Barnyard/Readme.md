My first working Bot.

Long after Series of shorter timeframe SMAs above longer SMAs. EMA slope is up. Previously named "Winner Long". Treid the exact opposite with a short, but it didn't work.

Long: RSI crosses above 34. One candle back was green. Now this one is too.

## Lydia15

Long entry: Using the 1-minute chart, price crosses above the SMA20 and current candle is green. The advantage of using this bot to work from, is that it too 288 trades --  an average of almost 5 perday.
