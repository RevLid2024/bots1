# Lydia's Trading Bots

These are the Ninja trading bots that appear to be working well. The variables were calculated very specifically for the ES. To view my updated spreadsheet estimated performance, go to [My Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dzkn98K6t8bCk7rMwND_1eEDjMVcMsebt0tExMt18JU/edit?usp=sharing)

## Lydia 8 - riding a bull trend 
I call this our Rainbow Long, as I have colored the SMAs to appear in rainbow-like progression when the strategy is ready to trigger; It is in the 15 minute chart, and triggers after a series of shorter SMAs line up above longer SMA's. ATR needs to be above 5 to insure enough volatility. The stop is 1.3 times the target. The profit is 4 times the estimated max drawdown. It triggers an average of 1.5 times per day. 

LOVE IT BECAUSE.... The ratio of profit to max drawdown is 4:1

BUT....The average trade takes 13 minutes, so it's more of a swing trade, in my book. 

## Lydia18 - catching a reversal after a bull trend
This is a long strategy after a bear trend. It uses the 15 minute chart. It triggers the RSI has been low, and crosses back above 34. Also it needs two green closes in a row. So far, this is my favorite strategy because the profit is ten times the drawdown and the win rate is 90%. The downside is that the stop loss is 2.75 times the profit target. It triggers about one time per day

LOVE IT BECAUSE....it has a 90% win rate

BUT.... the stop is 2.75 times the target

## Lyda19 - catching a reversal up after a bear trend
This is a short strategy as a bull trend pulls back. It uses the 5 minute chart. It triggers the RSI has been above 70 and crosses back below 70. Also it needs two red candles in a row and the ATR to be above 1. It wins 84% of the time, and triggers about once a day. 

LOVE IT BECAUSE....

This long entry is a 6-tick scalp on the 10-second chart. It triggers when the SMA 4 crosses above SMA 50. One bar back was green. Current bar is green so far. Volume is 1.3 times that of previous bars and ATR is at least .6. It has a stoploss (10) that is greater than the target (6) and the win rate is 71%, so it's not crazy good, but it does trigger 2.5 times per day. This makes for a healthy profit of 5 times the max drawndown. 

## Lydia25
This short entry is a 6-tick scalp on the 2 minute chart. The SMA4 crosses below SMA50 within the last five candles. Entry is on the second candle to close red in a row. ATR must be above 5. I like this one because the target (14) is about the distance of the stop (15), and the profit is more than 4 times the max drawdown. It triggers about once each day, and has a 73% win rate.
